# sylph  
*A Operating System Powered by What You Hide.*

## Overview

**sylph** is a minimal, privacy-focused digital environment that reflects your **subconscious digital behavior**. Instead of tracking what you post, click, or share — it learns from what you almost did but didn't:

- Deleted thoughts  
- Abandoned searches  
- Tabs you opened and closed  
- Unposted drafts  
- Hesitations and digital shadows  

It creates a **shadow profile** — a private, evolving reflection of your authentic self.

## Key Features

- **Sylph.x**  
  A private stream of your ghost data: erased text, hovered topics, and forgotten trails.

- **Sylph.e**  
  Shows the gap between your public digital persona and your hidden interests.

- **Sylph.decay**  
  The OS organically degrades unused files and UI based on subconscious emotional trends.

- **Encrypted, Ephemeral Workspace**
  A creation space that vanishes if you try to publish of capture it.
  Desgined for pure thought-- free from metrics and validation.

## Privacy First

- Everything is **stored locally** — nothing is uploaded.  
- No trackers, analytics, or accounts.  
- Your data is yours — and it fades over time, like real memory.
